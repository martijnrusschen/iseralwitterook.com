# Is er al witte rook?

A website that shows whether white smoke has appeared from the Sistine Chapel, indicating the election of a new Pope. The site also displays the latest news about the Pope and Vatican from Dutch news sources.

## Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Serve the files using a PHP-enabled server (e.g., Apache, XAMPP, MAMP)

For testing without a PHP server, the site includes a fallback to mock data.

- `index.html` - The main webpage
